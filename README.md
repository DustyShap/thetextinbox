# The Text Inbox
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DustyShap/thetextinbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DustyShap/thetextinbox)

Experimental application designed to replace existing text inbox application for [The Morning After](http://insidestl.com/radio-shows/the-morning-after) radio show.

Allows for two views - one, a normal view that allows anyone to view incoming texts and usernames, and an admin view which allows the admin user to view and edit phone numbers and names.
